## Areas of improvement

	1.	Frontend Design Precision
Delivered functional UIs (Streamlit, Framer), but lacked polish in responsiveness, layout, and user onboarding.
â†’ Next: Deepen Figma/Tailwind knowledge for cleaner interfaces.
	
 2.	Structured Evaluation of AI Tools
Startup assessments were insightful but ad hoc.
â†’ Next: Build a consistent evaluation grid (e.g. defensibility, ROI, use-case fit).
	
 3.	Backend & Data Layer Depth
Handled logic in Python, but didnâ€™t build a scalable backend or persistent database.
â†’ Next: Learn full-stack patterns (PostgreSQL, auth, file storage).
	
 4.	SharePoint Automation
Integration stayed manual.
â†’ Next: Explore Graph API or Power Automate to enable syncing and smart triggers.
	
 5.	Quantifying AI Gains
Time-saving was visible, but not tracked.
â†’ Next: Define KPIs for automation impact (e.g. memo speed, deal triage time).
	
 6.	Reusable Agent Architecture
Each agent was effective but bespoke.
â†’ Next: Create modular GPT patterns for better scalability across ventures.
	
 7.	Regulatory Awareness
Explored ESG reporting prompts but not legal/audit risk of AI output.
â†’ Next: Study AI governance frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST, CSRD alignment).
