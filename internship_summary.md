## Areas of improvement

1.	Frontend Design Precision
Delivered functional UIs (Streamlit, Framer), but lacked polish in responsiveness, layout, and user onboarding.
‚Üí Next: Deepen Figma/Tailwind knowledge for cleaner interfaces.
	
 2.	Structured Evaluation of AI Tools
Startup assessments were insightful but ad hoc.
‚Üí Next: Build a consistent evaluation grid (e.g. defensibility, ROI, use-case fit).
	
 3.	Backend & Data Layer Depth
Handled logic in Python, but didn‚Äôt build a scalable backend or persistent database.
‚Üí Next: Learn full-stack patterns (PostgreSQL, auth, file storage).
	
 4.	SharePoint Automation
Integration stayed manual.
‚Üí Next: Explore Graph API or Power Automate to enable syncing and smart triggers.
	
 5.	Quantifying AI Gains
Time-saving was visible, but not tracked.
‚Üí Next: Define KPIs for automation impact (e.g. memo speed, deal triage time).
	
 6.	Reusable Agent Architecture
Each agent was effective but bespoke.
‚Üí Next: Create modular GPT patterns for better scalability across ventures.
	
 7.	Regulatory Awareness
Explored ESG reporting prompts but not legal/audit risk of AI output.
‚Üí Next: Study AI governance frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST, CSRD alignment).

## Secret(s) and insights from the Internship

A lot of real work happened between tasks: 
- Many contributions were often spontaneous: summarizing a doc, rephrasing a pitch mid-meeting, or finding a tool in 15 minutes that could save hours later.
- The internship wasn‚Äôt about big ‚Äúprojects‚Äù but many of small, high-leverage moments.

Ferr√©ol believes that AI‚Äôs true potential is still underappreciated, while current SaaS-based AI platforms are overhyped relative to the real value they deliver.

It was highly visible during this internship for Ferreol that Ai is evolving extremelyyyyy fast.
