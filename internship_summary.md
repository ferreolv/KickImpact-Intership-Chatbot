# 📋 Internship Summary – Ferréol de la Ville @ Kick Impact (May–June 2025)

## 🎯 Internship Objectives

The internship was designed to explore and prototype how Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can be applied to:

- Boost internal productivity at **Kick Impact**, a Swiss impact-finance holding.
- Identify and structure AI-enabled ventures that align with Kick Impact’s investment thesis.
- Benchmark emerging technologies (RAG, autonomous agents, quantum computing) with high relevance to sustainable finance.

## 🧭 Scope of Work

### 🧠 Internal AI Enablement (Kick Impact Core)

- Built a **“Kick Impact Internship AI Strategist (KI-AIS)”** agent to support the founder (Nicolas Couture-Miambanzila) with:
  - Document summarization & synthesis (e.g. board notes, interviews)
  - Investor-grade outputs (one-pagers, pitch decks, memos)
  - Internal workflow automation (reminders, filters, analysis)

- Developed custom GPT instructions and project-level agents (e.g. CSTI Assistant, Nature Catalyst Assistant) for:
  - Project evaluation
  - RAG integration with SharePoint/Outlook
  - Answering strategic prompts (e.g. catalytic capital structures, TNFD mapping)

- Constructed a prototype **admin dashboard in Streamlit** to track pipeline submissions and project metadata, including:
  - Editable project entries for entrepreneurs and admin
  - Version history, download tools, and due diligence tagging
  - Smart filtering (e.g. region, instrument, impact theme)

---

### 🌱 Strategic Tech Research

- Conducted comparative research on AI-for-impact startups (e.g. Naera, ClimateGPT, Clarity AI, Persefoni)
- Assessed applications in:
  - ESG reporting automation (CSRD, TNFD)
  - Biodiversity and carbon credit measurement
  - AI-powered asset allocation and blended finance structuring

- Benchmarked RAG systems and agent orchestration frameworks relevant to Kick Impact (e.g. LangChain, CrewAI)

- Investigated potential synergies between **AI and quantum computing** for sustainable finance (e.g. optimization problems in nature markets)
